                                Sky Park Farm was purchased by its owners, Pierce and Victoria Noonan in August 2016. Situated in the picturesque hamlet of West Harting in the fields below their family home at Sky House, it covers an area of approximately 75 acres of the South Downs National Park.

                                The land that forms Sky Park Farm stretches north/south along Durford Lane to the banks of the River Rother, just across from the site of the ruins of the ancient Roman Catholic monastery of Durford Abbey, which was built in 1161, where it enjoys 435 meters of its own fishing rights. The river flows in an easterly direction where it meets Durford Mill, which was once the principal mill for the area and in 1585 was the property of Queen Elizabeth I.

                                Prior to its sale in 2016, the farm had not changed hands since 1958, when it was known as Rival Lodge Farm, being bought by two brothers, who were partners together in a successful market garden business (Bryant Brothers) growing vegetables, which they then sold on their regular pitch at Petersfield Market, as well as in their shops at Petersfield and Liss; one brother eventually buying the other brother’s share of the farm in 1967. At the time of the farm’s purchase in 1958, it was somewhat smaller, covering 48 acres, with subsequent acquisitions of adjoining fields bringing it up to the 75 acres that it is today.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The farm carried on successfully with its vegetable growing business up until the mid 1980’s, whilst at the same time running a herd of cattle, as well as up to 700 pigs. Sadly, however, in 1985 the farm entered a difficult period, brought about as a result of the owner of the farm suffering a protracted ten-year illness, which ultimately led to his demise, bringing with it a reverse of fortunes for the farm that would last for several decades.

                                Unfortunately the death of the owner had left the farm in a state of relative limbo, with no clear successor to take over its running and therefore no one person with a vested interest to provide the direction and financial input that was so desperately needed. As a result, the farm as a commercial agricultural enterprise was in a state of virtual paralysis, spelling the beginning of a difficult period in its history.

                                The vegetable growing side of the business had already closed down in 1983 and this was followed six years later in 1989 with the closure of the pig business, leaving only the legacy of its herd of cattle to provide any form of income.
